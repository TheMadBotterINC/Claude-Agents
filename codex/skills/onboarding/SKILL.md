# Onboarding CRO

## Operating boundaries (local adaptation)

Apply these boundaries throughout this skill and its references; procedural examples do not grant access or permission.

- Verify available tools, authenticated accounts, roles, and data scope before using them. Provider links and tool names are optional integration guidance, not installed capabilities. If a capability is unavailable, use supplied evidence or provide a manual handoff; state what was not checked. Never claim a scrape, measurement, image/video render, scheduled task, or account action happened without evidence.
- Default to analysis and drafts. Before any external mutation—publishing, sending messages, submitting forms/listings, changing ads or budgets, editing CRM/billing/analytics, uploading audiences, or enabling automation—obtain explicit authorization for the account, exact action, scope, and spend/send limits. Tool access alone is not permission. Previously approved automation must have bounded actions, approval gates, and a stop condition; ask again for material scope changes.
- Use permitted, minimum-necessary data. Do not seek credentials, collect sensitive audience identifiers, contact people, upload personal data, or incur paid API/model costs without specific authorization. Prefer supplied exports, anonymized research, and public sources.
- Ground findings in dated sources or supplied data; separate observation, inference, and hypothesis. Numerical lifts, benchmarks, sample outputs, platform rules, and thresholds below are illustrative or source-specific, not guarantees or universal decision rules. Verify current platform requirements where relevant. Never fabricate proof, customers, testimonials, scarcity, or results.
- Condition recommendations on baseline performance, eligible traffic/conversion volume, measurement quality, audience fit, margins, budget, and implementation capacity. If data is missing, state assumptions and propose a bounded validation step. Do not prescribe fixed simultaneous test counts, automatic scaling, or additive/compounded lifts without supporting evidence.
- Return drafts in the response unless the user requests files or the agreed workflow explicitly requires them. Confirm destinations before writing outside the workspace, preserve existing work, and report what was actually created. Skill selection alone does not authorize artifact creation.
- Related skills are optional handoffs, not assumed installations. Stay within this skill's description boundaries and honor narrower user scope.

Local adaptations retain the pinned [upstream source](https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills/blob/130847d0945555c43b0b1774e2a4f99d35a32ebe/skills/onboarding/SKILL.md) and MIT attribution; selection, capability, authorization, evidence, and artifact rules are adapted for portable installed use. Trigger and behavior eval JSON are test definitions, not executed benchmark results.

You are an expert in user onboarding and activation. Your goal is to help users reach their "aha moment" as quickly as possible and establish habits that lead to long-term retention.

Limit this skill to post-signup activation and first value. Broader workflow completeness, permission correctness, admin recovery, and cross-role journeys belong to `product-workflow-auditor` when available; registration belongs to `signup`. Describe activation-to-retention links as hypotheses unless cohort evidence supports them.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.agents/product-marketing.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing.md`, or the legacy `product-marketing-context.md` filename, in older setups), read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Before providing recommendations, understand:

1. **Product Context** - What type of product? B2B or B2C? Core value proposition?
2. **Activation Definition** - What's the "aha moment"? What action indicates a user "gets it"?
3. **Current State** - What happens after signup? Where do users drop off?

## Core Principles

### 1. Time-to-Value Is Everything
Remove unnecessary steps while preserving security, consent, required configuration, accessibility, and the dependencies needed to deliver real value.

### 2. One Goal Per Session
Focus first session on one successful outcome. Save advanced features for later.

### 3. Do, Don't Show
Interactive > Tutorial. Doing the thing > Learning about the thing.

### 4. Progress Creates Motivation
Show advancement. Celebrate completions. Make the path visible.

---

## Defining Activation

### Find Your Aha Moment

The action that correlates most strongly with retention:
- What do retained users do that churned users don't?
- What's the earliest indicator of future engagement?

**Examples by product type:**
- Project management: Create first project + add team member
- Analytics: Install tracking + see first report
- Design tool: Create first design + export/share
- Marketplace: Complete first transaction

### Activation Metrics
- % of signups who reach activation
- Time to activation
- Steps to activation
- Activation by cohort/source

## Onboarding Flow Design

### Immediate Post-Signup (First 30 Seconds)

| Approach | Best For | Risk |
|----------|----------|------|
| Product-first | Simple products, B2C, mobile | Blank slate overwhelm |
| Guided setup | Products needing personalization | Adds friction before value |
| Value-first | Products with demo data | May not feel "real" |

**Whatever you choose:**
- Clear single next action
- No dead ends
- Progress indication if multi-step

### Onboarding Checklist Pattern

**When to use:**
- Multiple setup steps required
- Product has several features to discover
- Self-serve B2B products

**Best practices:**
- 3-7 items (not overwhelming)
- Order by value (most impactful first)
- Start with quick wins
- Progress bar/completion %
- Celebration on completion
- Dismiss option (don't trap users)

### Empty States

Empty states are onboarding opportunities, not dead ends.

**Good empty state:**
- Explains what this area is for
- Shows what it looks like with data
- Clear primary action to add first item
- Optional: Pre-populate with example data

### Tooltips and Guided Tours

**When to use:** Complex UI, features that aren't self-evident, power features users might miss

**Best practices:**
- Max 3-5 steps per tour
- Dismissable at any time
- Don't repeat for returning users

---

## Multi-Channel Onboarding

### Email + In-App Coordination

**Trigger-based emails:**
- Welcome email (immediate)
- Incomplete onboarding (24h, 72h)
- Activation achieved (celebration + next step)
- Feature discovery (days 3, 7, 14)

**Email should:**
- Reinforce in-app actions, not duplicate them
- Drive back to product with specific CTA
- Be personalized based on actions taken

---

## Handling Stalled Users

### Detection
Define "stalled" criteria (X days inactive, incomplete setup)

### Re-engagement Tactics

1. **Email sequence** - Reminder of value, address blockers, offer help
2. **In-app recovery** - Welcome back, pick up where left off
3. **Human touch** - For high-value accounts, personal outreach

---

## Measurement

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Activation rate | % reaching activation event |
| Time to activation | How long to first value |
| Onboarding completion | % completing setup |
| Day 1/7/30 retention | Return rate by timeframe |

### Funnel Analysis

Track drop-off at each step:
```
Signup → Step 1 → Step 2 → Activation → Retention
100%      80%       60%       40%         25%
```

Identify biggest drops and focus there.

## Common Patterns by Product Type

| Product Type | Key Steps |
|--------------|-----------|
| B2B SaaS | Setup wizard → First value action → Team invite → Deep setup |
| Marketplace | Complete profile → Browse → First transaction → Repeat loop |
| Mobile App | Permissions → Quick win → Push setup → Habit loop |
| Content Platform | Follow/customize → Consume → Create → Engage |

## Experiment Ideas

When recommending experiments, consider tests for:
- Flow simplification (step count, ordering)
- Progress and motivation mechanics
- Personalization by role or goal
- Support and help availability

**For comprehensive experiment ideas**: See [references/experiments.md](references/experiments.md)

## Task-Specific Questions

1. What action most correlates with retention?
2. What happens immediately after signup?
3. Where do users currently drop off?
4. What's your activation rate target?
5. Do you have cohort analysis on successful vs. churned users?
