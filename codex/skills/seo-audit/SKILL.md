# SEO Audit

## Operating boundaries (local adaptation)

Apply these boundaries throughout this skill and its references; procedural examples do not grant access or permission.

- Verify available tools, authenticated accounts, roles, and data scope before using them. Provider links and tool names are optional integration guidance, not installed capabilities. If a capability is unavailable, use supplied evidence or provide a manual handoff; state what was not checked. Never claim a scrape, measurement, image/video render, scheduled task, or account action happened without evidence.
- Default to analysis and drafts. Before any external mutation—publishing, sending messages, submitting forms/listings, changing ads or budgets, editing CRM/billing/analytics, uploading audiences, or enabling automation—obtain explicit authorization for the account, exact action, scope, and spend/send limits. Tool access alone is not permission. Previously approved automation must have bounded actions, approval gates, and a stop condition; ask again for material scope changes.
- Use permitted, minimum-necessary data. Do not seek credentials, collect sensitive audience identifiers, contact people, upload personal data, or incur paid API/model costs without specific authorization. Prefer supplied exports, anonymized research, and public sources.
- Ground findings in dated sources or supplied data; separate observation, inference, and hypothesis. Numerical lifts, benchmarks, sample outputs, platform rules, and thresholds below are illustrative or source-specific, not guarantees or universal decision rules. Verify current platform requirements where relevant. Never fabricate proof, customers, testimonials, scarcity, or results.
- Condition recommendations on baseline performance, eligible traffic/conversion volume, measurement quality, audience fit, margins, budget, and implementation capacity. If data is missing, state assumptions and propose a bounded validation step. Do not prescribe fixed simultaneous test counts, automatic scaling, or additive/compounded lifts without supporting evidence.
- Return drafts in the response unless the user requests files or the agreed workflow explicitly requires them. Confirm destinations before writing outside the workspace, preserve existing work, and report what was actually created. Skill selection alone does not authorize artifact creation.
- Related skills are optional handoffs, not assumed installations. Stay within this skill's description boundaries and honor narrower user scope.

Local adaptations retain the pinned [upstream source](https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills/blob/130847d0945555c43b0b1774e2a4f99d35a32ebe/skills/seo-audit/SKILL.md) and MIT attribution; selection, capability, authorization, evidence, and artifact rules are adapted for portable installed use. Trigger and behavior eval JSON are test definitions, not executed benchmark results.

You are an expert in search engine optimization. Your goal is to identify SEO issues and provide actionable recommendations to improve organic search performance.

Keep speed checks tied to search visibility and the agreed SEO scope. For standalone performance measurement, bundle analysis, LCP/INP profiling, or rendering diagnostics, hand off to `web-performance` if available; do not claim field Core Web Vitals from a single lab run. Distinguish retrieved source, rendered observation, field data, and untested hypotheses.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.agents/product-marketing.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing.md`, or the legacy `product-marketing-context.md` filename, in older setups), read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Before auditing, understand:

1. **Site Context**
   - What type of site? (SaaS, e-commerce, blog, etc.)
   - What's the primary business goal for SEO?
   - What keywords/topics are priorities?

2. **Current State**
   - Any known issues or concerns?
   - Current organic traffic level?
   - Recent changes or migrations?

3. **Scope**
   - Full site audit or specific pages?
   - Technical + on-page, or one focus area?
   - Access to Search Console / analytics?

## Audit Framework

### Schema Markup Detection Limitation

**Static HTTP or text retrieval and `curl` cannot reliably detect structured data / schema markup.**

Many CMS plugins (AIOSEO, Yoast, RankMath) inject JSON-LD via client-side JavaScript — it may not appear in static HTML or text-converted page output, especially when `<script>` tags are omitted.

**To accurately check for schema markup, use one of these methods:**
1. **Browser tool** — render the page and run: `document.querySelectorAll('script[type="application/ld+json"]')`
2. **Google Rich Results Test** — https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
3. **Screaming Frog export** — if the client provides one, use it (SF renders JavaScript)

Reporting "no schema found" based solely on static retrieval or `curl` leads to false audit findings — those methods can't see JS-injected schema.

### Priority Order
1. **Crawlability & Indexation** (can Google find and index it?)
2. **Technical Foundations** (is the site fast and functional?)
3. **On-Page Optimization** (is content optimized?)
4. **Content Quality** (does it deserve to rank?)
5. **Authority & Links** (does it have credibility?)

## International SEO & Localization

Check when the site serves multiple languages or regions. Misconfigurations can suppress indexing of entire locale variants or drag down site-wide quality signals. See [International SEO reference](references/international-seo.md) for evidence and source URLs.

### Hreflang

Three equivalent placement methods: HTML `<link>` in `<head>`, HTTP `Link` headers, XML sitemap `<xhtml:link>`. If using multiple, they must agree -- conflicting signals cause Google to drop that pair. For 10+ locales, prefer sitemap-based (no page weight, no per-request cost).

**Check for:**
- Self-referencing entry on every page (page must include itself in the hreflang set)
- Reciprocal links (if A points to B, B must point back to A -- or both are ignored)
- Valid codes: ISO 639-1 language + optional ISO 3166-1 Alpha 2 region (e.g., `en`, `en-GB` -- never `en-UK`)
- `x-default` present, pointing to fallback page (language selector or default locale)
- All target URLs return 200, are indexable, and match their canonical URL
- No duplicate language-region codes pointing to different URLs

**Common errors:** Missing self-referencing entry (all hreflang ignored). No return tag / one-directional (pair dropped). Invalid codes like `en-UK` (use `en-GB`). Hreflang target is non-canonical, 404, or blocked (cluster discarded). HTML and sitemap annotations disagree (conflicting pair dropped).

**At scale:** `<xhtml:link>` children don't count toward 50K URL sitemap limit, but the 50MB file size limit becomes the bottleneck (plan 2K-5K URLs per file with full hreflang). Focus hreflang on pages receiving wrong-language traffic -- not required on every page. For Bing: supplement with `<html lang>` and `<meta http-equiv="content-language">` (Bing treats hreflang as a weak signal).

### Canonicalization for Multilingual Sites

- Each locale page must self-canonical (e.g., `/ar/page` canonicals to `/ar/page`)
- Never cross-locale canonical (French to English) -- suppresses the non-canonical locale entirely
- Canonical URL must appear in the hreflang set -- if not, all hreflang is ignored
- Canonical overrides hreflang when they conflict
- Protocol/domain must be consistent across canonical, hreflang, and sitemap (`https` + same domain variant)
- Paginated locale pages: self-referencing canonical per page (never canonical page 2+ to page 1)

**Common mistakes:** all locales canonical to English (kills indexing), canonical URL not in hreflang set (silently ignored), protocol mismatch between canonical and hreflang, CMS setting deep page canonical to homepage.

### International Sitemaps

**Check for:**
- `xmlns:xhtml` namespace on `<urlset>`, each `<url>` includes `<xhtml:link>` for all locales including itself
- `x-default` alternate included; all URLs absolute (full protocol + domain)
- Sitemap index in Search Console and robots.txt; split by content type, not by locale

**Next.js caveat:** `alternates.languages` does NOT auto-include a self-referencing `<xhtml:link>` for the `<loc>` URL -- you must add the current locale explicitly.

### Locale URL Structure

**Recommended:** Subdirectories (`/en/`, `/ar/`). **Acceptable:** Subdomains or ccTLDs. **Not recommended:** URL parameters (`?lang=en`).

**Check for:**
- Consistent locale prefix strategy; all locales prefixed (hiding locale from URLs prevents Google from distinguishing versions)
- Root URL handled as `x-default` with redirect, or serves default locale content
- No IP/Accept-Language content negotiation (Googlebot: US IPs, no Accept-Language header)
- Trailing slash + case consistency across locale paths, canonicals, hreflang, and sitemaps
- 301 redirects from non-canonical format to canonical

**Note:** Google's International Targeting report in Search Console is deprecated. Geotargeting relies on hreflang, content signals, and linking patterns.

### Content Quality Across Locales

**Translation quality:**
- AI-translated content is not inherently spam (Google's 2025 stance), but scaled low-value translations can trigger scaled content abuse policy
- Google uses visible content to determine language -- translate ALL page content (title, description, headings, body), not just boilerplate
- Translating only template/nav while main content stays in original language creates duplicates

**Thin locale pages:**
- Helpful content system is site-wide -- many thin locale pages can suppress rankings for strong pages too
- Don't noindex thin locales (wastes crawl budget) or cross-locale canonical (conflicts with hreflang)
- Best approach: don't create locale pages you cannot make genuinely helpful

**Check for:**
- All locale pages have fully translated main content (not just UI chrome)
- No near-identical content across locales ("Duplicate, Google chose different canonical" in GSC)
- Hreflang only for locales with genuine content and search demand
- Localized signals: currency, phone format, addresses where applicable
- Broken hreflang links (404s, redirects) waste crawl budget AND invalidate hreflang clusters
